The significance of this research lies in its potential to improve healthcare delivery and increase clinic efficiency. Non-attendance at appointments is a challenge for both patients and providers, leading to delayed care, increased costs, and lost time for providers. The research was inspired by the author's experience as a licensed vocational nurse in a public health clinic in [City] where appointments were often booked out three months in advance and non-attendance was a frequent issue. The goal was to prevent missed appointments and inform the extent to which appointments could be double-booked.
